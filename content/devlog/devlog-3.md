I converted my system into a local server.
Doing this might be the best decision I have taken.

`How ?`

I was lucky that I converted my old laptop to an desktop!
This meant I didn't have to suffer through charging and discharging my laptop.

So I made this old-new desktop my primary workplace, converting my laptop into a stationary server.
