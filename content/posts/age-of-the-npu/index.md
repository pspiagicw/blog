Apple just had their WWDC, which unveiled their masterplan to rename the acronym of A.I.

The buzzword for the conference was the `NPU`. Microsoft with their death sentence of a `Copilot +` PC also focused on the NPU inside the processors.

Apparently they are the new requirements for on-device A.I features to run properly. 

Hasn't this trend already been done ? The `GPU` was the buzzword then.

Are we seeing another hardware competition ? Maybe,

- 2000s was the age of the CPU. (We broke 1GHz and reached 5GHz, then we changed the architecture)
- 2010s was the age of the GPU. (You got broke, also broke some A.I nerds)
- 2020s will be the age of NPU. (Wallet's won't break, corporates will love it).
