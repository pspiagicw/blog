Let me describe my current development environment to you.

I run PopOS, mainly for it's gaming features and it's stability. I was using Gentoo and I shifted to PopOS when my life demanded stability.
But I don't code on PopOS, I code on `archlinux`.

My text editor is not installed on my operating system. Hell even `pip` is not installed!

My coding tools live inside a docker container.
